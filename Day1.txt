What is ZeroToFullStack?

Zero To Full Stack is my way to help others enter the field of software development. I taught myself to code and now I’m making a 6 figure salary and it’s really changed my life. I want others to see this kind of growth but hopefully with a little less friction.

I took a long and winding road to get where I am. It feels like endless nights of reading articles, learning different languages, frameworks and libraries, watching YouTube videos and even reading the Twitter threads of successful engineers. I found plenty of great things, but also some things that were irrelevant, hard to understand or just plain boring. My goal with Z2FS is that I can help you recreate my journey, but ONLY the pieces are valuable. 

There will certainly be a few things that are “tangents” or “strings to pull on” if you’re interested. These are things that would help add to the overall software education, but are not required. I will point these out as potential roads to explore, but I’ll leave you to decide if you want to travel down them. 


So do you climb this stack? Well I’ve drawn my inspiration from video games. I have create a “skill tree” for your to climb. I’ll start with the most basic concepts, and easiest tools and get increasingly difficult as we go. At a certain point you’ll become eligible for interview practice and career training. At all points you’ll have access to the community who are there as your comrades allong the way. 

I hope you’ll enjoy this project and I can’t wait to see you in the Slack Channels.
