# Static-Text-Analysis

I've always been interested in understanding the text I'm reading. 

Being a math/tech nerd this also extends to the meta-data about the text. 

How long is it? 
How many sentances? 
How large are the words?
Is the text filled with filler words?
How would this translate?


This repo is an attempt at capturing that itch. The primary test data will be a collection of my own blog posts that I will publish at a later date as part of an online curriculum I'm trying to make for others to learn how to code using the javascript/typescript stack.
